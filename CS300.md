***ABCU Advising Program CS300 Data Structures and Algorithms Category***

The sorting algorithm for the ABCU Advising Program to optimize the organization of student course data. This artifact aimed to streamline the advising process by enabling advisors to sort and retrieve records quickly and accurately based on criteria such as course names or enrollment status. The project emphasized the practical application of data structures and algorithms in solving real-world problems.

The sorting algorithm was designed to be efficient, scalable, and customizable, capable of handling both small and large datasets without performance degradation. By integrating the algorithm into the advising program, the project improved functionality, allowing advisors to make informed course recommendations and schedule plans with ease. The artifact showcased the importance of algorithmic efficiency through a focus on time and space complexity.

The project demonstrated how computational thinking and modular code design could enhance software systems. The project compares Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort, examining their computational complexities and performance trade-offs. Each algorithm was implemented in Python and evaluated across datasets of varying sizes and distributions to demonstrate their practical applications and limitations.

This project emphasized critical skills in algorithm design, analysis, and optimization. Bubble Sort provided a baseline with its simplicity but revealed inefficiencies with larger datasets due to its
