Software Design and Engineering Category**

The Inventory application facilitates the tracking of inventory items primarily through mobile devices, enhancing the management and automation of warehouse logistics. This functionality not only supports operational efficiency but also accelerates business growth and expansion. By providing real-time inventory visibility across various devices, the app ensures users can access the system from any location. Initially, the app was developed for Android devices, leveraging the Android SDK API 16 (Jelly Bean), which ensures compatibility with approximately 99.8% of devices.

In developing the mobile app, I chose to use the JAVA programming language, setting a minimum requirement of Android SDK API 16. Throughout the development process, I collaborated with others to address programmatic challenges, benefiting from shared expertise and collective problem-solving. This collaborative approach was invaluable, as it broadened my knowledge and enhanced the overall development of the app.

I adhered to industry best practices for JAVA coding, emphasizing clarity and maintainability. This included using in-line comments, adhering to proper naming conventions, and ensuring consistent formatting and indentation to improve code readability. Class names were written in camelCase, while layout files used lowercase naming. Global variables followed the camelCase CapWords convention, while method variables adhered to lower camelCase or lower-case dash_names conventions. Method names were carefully chosen to reflect their functionality, and comments were employed to summarize the purpose of each class and method. Methods that override superclass methods were named with an initial lowercase word in camelCase, while other methods followed a standard camelCase format with capitalized words.

User authentication is achieved through the combination of a name and email address, with the phone number serving as a recovery option for forgotten passwords. These security features highlight our commitment to a zero-trust architecture, prioritizing the identification and mitigation of potential vulnerabilities. Throughout the software development lifecycle, we emphasized secure coding practices and conducted thorough product assurance, testing, and compatibility checks to safeguard data integrity and ensure privacy.

In designing and developing the mobile app components within the Android Studio IDE, I was able to demonstrate my understanding of the relationships between activities, elements, and their integration with the app's code. By applying mobile development principles, user-centered design methodologies, and industry standards, I ensured that the app not only meets technical specifications but also offers a secure, user-friendly experience. Prior to launch, extensive security reviews and compatibility testing were conducted to guarantee a seamless and secure user experience.
