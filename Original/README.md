Code reviews are an essential practice that not only identify errors early when rectifications are more cost-effective but also strengthen the team's overall capabilities, fostering greater fault tolerance within the organization. This process enables better recovery from disruptive changes, leading to more maintainable and robust code. Through conducting code reviews of selected artifacts in software design and engineering, algorithms and data structures, and database management, I was able to develop and apply strategies that promote collaborative environments. These environments support informed decision-making in the field of computer science by critically analyzing existing code functionality and suggesting enhancements.

In the process of reviewing the original code for the three artifacts, I assessed their weaknesses, limitations, and vulnerabilities, and outlined a comprehensive plan for their improvement. The code review itself involved a thorough walkthrough of the existing source code and proposed enhancements. Through this process, I have continually refined my ability to deliver professional-quality communication in oral, written, and visual formats, effectively explaining code reviews within collaborative settings. These communications are crafted to be coherent, technically precise, and tailored to the specific needs of diverse audiences and contexts.

Inventory Mobile Application - CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming

This application was conceived, designed, and developed as part of the CS360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course. Its primary objective is to facilitate inventory tracking through a mobile device. I developed the app using the JAVA programming language and integrated it with an SQLite database to ensure efficient data management.

ABCU Advising Program - CS300 Data Structures and Algorithms

Developed as part of the CS300 Data Structures and Algorithms course, this program equips students with a deep understanding of key data structures such as arrays, linked lists, and trees, while teaching efficient algorithm design and analysis. The course emphasizes problem-solving skills and algorithmic efficiency, preparing students for advanced topics and real-world applications in computer science. This program was developed using c++.

Salvare Search for Rescue Web Application - CS340 Client/Server Development

This web application was developed as part of the CS340 Client-Server Development course, aiming to create a user-friendly interface that interacts with an existing animal shelter database. The application helps identify and categorize available dogs for rescue training. It was developed using Python with the Dash framework and integrated with MongoDB, a non-relational database, through the PyMongo driver. Jupyter Notebook was utilized as a testing tool to validate the functionality of the web application.
